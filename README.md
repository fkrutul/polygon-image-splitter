# SplitterTest

This script splits images with polygonal annotations into sub-images in a way that preserves the positional integrity and boundaries of the annotations. Useful for generating training data for object instance segmentation models (Poly-RNN++, Mask R-CNN, etc.). The code was tested on images annotated using the VGG Image Annotator software.
